# IX1500-Diskret-Matte

This repository contains my solution to **Project 1** in the course *IX1500 – Discrete Mathematics*.  
The problem models a particle moving in the xy-plane, starting at `(0,4)` and ending at `(9,3)`. The particle moves according to the following rules:

- **U-step**: (m,n) → (m+1, n+1)  
- **L-step**: (m,n) → (m+1, n-1)  

The goal is to count and analyze all possible paths from a given start point to an end point, under different restrictions.

## Problem statement (Part 3.1)
The tasks are divided into subproblems:

1. **(a)** Count the total number of possible paths.  
2. **(b)** Count the number of paths that touch or cross the x-axis.  
3. **(c)** Count the number of paths that never touch the x-axis.
